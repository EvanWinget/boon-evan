From April 2015 through February 2016 I designed and built a cabin on my family farm about an hour outside of Cincinnati. I was working at an ecommerce company during the week, and would spend evenings after work planning the weekend tasks. On Friday I'd head to the hardware store or lumber yard and buy the materials on my way out to the farm, and then spend a few days building with whichever family and friends I could convince to come volunteer free manual labor in the humid Ohio summer. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to my dad for being there almost every weekend.

From the outset there was no master plan for the cabin. Each week I would read articles and watch videos of whatever skill would be required for the upcoming weekend: framing walls, roofing, tiling, pulling wire, etc. Then I'd make a concrete plan for the weekend based on what I had learned and somehow it all came together in the end.  The photos below document the overall build from digging to a completed cabin.

_It was cheaper to buy 20' rebar than 10' pieces, so my uncle insisted that we bring an angle grinder along and cut the pieces down in the parking lot_

_Mixed all of the concrete and poured it in a day, mixing one 80-pound bag at a time in the small cement mixer_

_Used 6"x6" posts to hold up the 4"x12" beams and then placed floor joists on 16" centers_

_Was ready to tilt up walls by the 4th of July - tried to put one up aleady sheeted but it weighed way too much so we didn't repeat that experiment_
