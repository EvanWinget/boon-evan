In August 2019 I finished all of the coursework for my MBA at the University of Oxford and had a few weeks free before the end of course ceremony in September. My friend Manuel and I had talked about backpacking in Scotland all summer, but we were both international students and hadn't brought any backpacking or camping equipment with us to school.

On a Sunday night we decided that it didn't matter if we were ill-prepared. This was a unique opportunity to hike in a beautiful location and spend some time in nature after an entire year split between libraries and pubs.

We met on Monday morning at Argos when they opened at 8 a.m. and bought 2 backpacks, 2 sleeping bags, and a tent (we gave all of the gear away after finishing the trail). I wanted to buy a cheap 2-man tent with poles. Manu convinced me that a popup tent was actually the way to go. We rushed to the train and packed our bags while on the train to Glasgow, arriving with only a few hours of sunlight left to eat a final meal in the city and start hiking the West Highland Way to Fort William before dark.

_Popped the tent out just as the sun was going down - and it turns out this thing is *tiny*_

_The next morning we couldnt figure out how to put the tent back in the bag, so we just folded it as best we could and tied it to a backpack_
