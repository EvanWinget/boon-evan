### Welcome

Hi, I'm Evan Winget and I like to build things. Sometimes I use my hands, other times I use my head. Occasionally I rest and use neither.

You can read about some of the projects that I've worked on on the [Projects page](https://www.boon.org/projects/).

You can read more about _boon.org_ and the plans for this website on the [About page](https://www.boon.org/about/).

Send me an email if you want to have a chat - I'm usually quite good at responding quickly!
