### About 

The English definition of _boon_ is 'a thing that is helpful or beneficial'.

In Thai, the word บุญ (pronounced: _boon_) translates into 'good deeds' or 'merit'. The concept of merit is fundamental to Buddhist ethics, and making merit by performing good deeds is a key practice for Buddhists throughout the world. 

_boon.org_ is currently being used as my personal domain, but I plan to use it for a project in the future.
